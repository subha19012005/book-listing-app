# 📚 BookLi – Book Listing Web App

**BookLi** is a simple, responsive web application that allows users to manage their personal book collection. Users can add books with a title, author, and description, and also remove them when needed. This app was built using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript and stores book data temporarily during the session.
